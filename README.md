# CypressResume-Business-Card-Buider
Web App that creates business cards for customers. Design based off of client specifications.

This was a year long project for California State University Sacramento CSC undergraduates. The first semester was learning about the scrum
framework and gathering all the requirments from a client. The second semester was implementing the clients requirments to produce a product
that they may integrate into their current website.

The files included are all the assets needed to use the business card builder, however, they must be used on a server with appropriate permissions.
